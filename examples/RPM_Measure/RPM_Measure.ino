  Now we can use these new 16 ISR-based timers, while consuming only 1 hardware Timer.
  Their independently-selected, maximum interval is practically unlimited (limited only by unsigned long miliseconds)
  The accuracy is nearly perfect compared to software timers. The most important feature is they're ISR-based timers
  Therefore, their executions are not blocked by bad-behaving functions / tasks.
  This important feature is absolutely necessary for mission-critical tasks.

  Notes:
  Special design is necessary to share data between interrupt code and the rest of your program.
  Variables usually need to be "volatile" types. Volatile tells the compiler to avoid optimizations that assume
  variable can not spontaneously change. Because your function may change variables while your program is using them,
  the compiler needs this hint. But volatile alone is often not enough.
  When accessing shared variables, usually interrupts must be disabled. Even with volatile,
  if the interrupt changes a multi-byte variable between a sequence of instructions, it can be read incorrectly.
  If your data is multiple variables, such as an array and a count, usually interrupts need to be disabled
  or the entire sequence of your code which accesses the data.

/* RPM Measuring uses high frequency hardware timer 1Hz == 1ms) to measure the time from of one rotation, in ms
   then convert to RPM. One rotation is detected by reading the state of a magnetic REED SW or IR LED Sensor
   Asssuming LOW is active.
   For example: Max speed is 600RPM => 10 RPS => minimum 100ms a rotation. We'll use 80ms for debouncing
   If the time between active state is less than 8ms => consider noise.
   RPM = 60000 / (rotation time in ms)

   You can also use interrupt to detect whenever the SW is active, set a flag
   then use timer to count the time between active state
